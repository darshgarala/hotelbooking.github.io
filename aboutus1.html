        <p>
        If you’re reading this, it’s probably because you’re a hotel lover. Or
        hotel curious at least. But before we get to the objects of our
        affection, allow us to introduce ourselves…
      </p>

      <p>
        World__Hotel__  began life in 2003 with two adventurous hotel lovers and has evolved into a
        global travel club with more than a million like-minded members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our carefully curated (and responsibly sourced) collection now includes
        hotels in the sky (if you’ve never woken up in a treehouse, we can
        change that), hotels in caves, hotels above water, hotels underwater
        (well, partially), hotels a million miles away, hotels on your doorstep…
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work doesn’t stop with considered curation, mind. We ensure that our
        members receive the very best service, support and inspiration. It’s
        what makes us the travel club for hotel lovers. And if every club has a
        purpose, ours is to knock your socks off – with help from the world’s
        very best bedrooms…
